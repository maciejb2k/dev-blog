Recently I've been listening to [**Andrzej Krzywda**](https://www.instagram.com/andrzejkrzywda_po_polsku/) interviews, podcasts and lives. He talked a lot about personal brand and the idea of having your own blog for yourself, where you simply describe some issue you've recently learned about, your solutions to problems in code, or just about anything else.

I really like this idea because:
- I can practice a form of expression such as blog writing, which I am completely unfamiliar with.
- I can (and should) **improve my English** by writing posts, because I don't feel confident with writing long sentences gramatically correct in English.
- By summarizing my knowledge I will have better understaing of certain topics and there is a bigger chance that I will remember more things.
- Browsing my blog will quickly show what I'm currently doing and what problems I'm facing.

So I came up with this blog. I chose **Gatsby** as its main technology, because it's very fast, the content is pre-rendered and the most important, I can write posts in **markdown** files (where I'm taking all my personal notes). After making changes, I can simply commit new posts to GitHub and Vercel will automatically publish them under my domain.
