Some time ago [I posted an overview](https://dev-blog.maciejbiel.pl/git-commands-overview/) of common Git commands with simple explanations, what they do under the hood.

I'd like to push this topic even further and I'd like to share with you a missing part from the previous article, which is an **explanation of the most fundamental concepts in Git**, in the context of the `.git/` directory.

I have noticed, that Git is a very common yet often misunderstood topic, and in my opinion, this is due to a lack of a precise understanding of how it works under the hood.

I lanuched a separate website called **No Bullsh\*t Git** instead of writing blog post, because I wanted to have a dedicated place for this topic, with simple design and fast navigation.

Even though this guide covers a lot of technical aspects of Git, I tried my best to make this guide as simple and concise as possible.

I hope you'll find it useful.
